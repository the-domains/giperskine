_**How to Achieve Property
Management Success Without Bragging, Bravado or
Belittling Others**_

As property
managers, we work really hard at keeping our properties---and our clients---looking
good.

And yet, we have
this belief that our __results should
speak for themselves__. Somehow, they don't speak loud enough for us.

So, here are five
keys on how to boost your relevance as a property manager without bravado,
bragging or belittling others.

**__**

**_Key \#1: Accomplishments Journal_**

All our clients
are expecting the answer to the question, "What have you done for me lately?"
Or, as Steve Harrison said, they love their favorite radio station "WII-FM" or
"What's In It For Me?"

You can tell them
you now have a systematic method of capturing accomplishments over the past
week, month, or quarter.

It's called an __Accomplishments Journal__. You simply
drop those things in, and then relay them to our clients, in a very subtle way,
so you keep your value high and keep your information relevant to the
stakeholders you serve.

Speaking of
stakeholders...

**__**

**_Key \#2: Daily Gratitude_**

You have numerous
stakeholders:

* Your__clients
* Your
manager
* Your
team
* Your
vendors
* Your
tenants

They all want a
little piece of you.

Without them, you
have no job. So embrace the opportunity to express your appreciation for all the
reasons why you're there. Thank them for entrusting you with their issues.

Remember: _You're ___there__ to serve __them__ and make __them__ more valuable in __their__ roles so __they__ can
serve __their__ customers better.

Speaking of that...

**__**

**_Key \#3: Your Customer's Customer_**

This isn't the
way we usually think about things. We normally go through our daily tasks figuring
out how to keep the property up.

But, until we
actually step into the shoes of our customer---whether they be our:

* Residents
* Tenants
* Manager
* Owner

...and understand
how we can help them serve THEIR customers---we're not maximizing our
contribution.

It's __our job__ to understand our what
our customers do. That's how we can identify ways to support them better. That's
what's going to increase our value in this industry.

**__**

**_Key \#4: Increase Service Levels_**

We just
discovered that serving your customer's customer is a key to elevate value.
Now, it's time to do a little group think.

Meet with your
team and brainstorm creative ways to improve what you're doing now and increase
the level of service you're currently providing.

* Your
tenants
* Your
boss
* Your
company
* Your
owner

Take their
perspective and increase the level of service for them.

____

_**\*\*Bonus\*\***_

And, while you're
at it, give _your team_ the credit. It's your leadership that's motivating
them to produce at these new levels. And when you do so, _your value will
increase_ in the process.

Key number five,
and this is a big one...

**__**

**_Key \#5: May I Quote You?_**

You may be on the
phone with a customer, a tenant, or the owner of the building who just wanted
to express what a great job you've done in this past project.

Ask if you can
quote that person. 

_This elevates your value **without** having done any bragging on your own_.

Keep those quotes
in your _Accomplishments Journal_ so
your "relevance rights," (not "bragging rights") are all in one place.

And then you can
pass that along to your boss, to your company and actually increase your
relevance and get the recognition you deserve.
