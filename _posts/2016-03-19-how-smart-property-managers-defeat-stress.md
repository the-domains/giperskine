# How Smart Property Managers Defeat Stress

I saw a great saying the other day. It goes, "Working hard
for something we don't care about is called stress. Working hard for something
we love is called passion."

Stress is that ugly word that is thrown around whenever an
obstacle or frustration comes into your awareness. It's like a virus -- when you're
in stress, your mind, body and emotions react and seem to stir up more stress.
It becomes a never-ending cycle of agitation that impacts your decisions and
your ability to think rationally.

But there is an easy way to regain your perspective, return
to your creative powers and calm down your nervous system. It's as simple as
writing it down.

Create a _Stress Log.
_It is a separate list of the items that are causing stress. When you get it out
of your head and down on paper, several important things happen:

* **Relief**. You relieve the strong emotions you feel because of the
perceived person, place or thing causing you stress (the stressor). Writing it
down allows you (the "stressee") to step back and look at the situation more
objectively. It also helps to take a few deep breaths as you feel the emotional
impact of stress leave your body;

**Shrinkage**. The stressor shrinks to a manageable size when you write it
down. Instead of your imagination creating more stress by constantly reviewing
the stressor, putting it into words and writing it down actually weakens it; 

\* **Clarity**. As soon as you write it down, ask yourself what you can do
to find a solution. Now that the stressor is defined, your mind can work rationally
on finding a solution; and

\* **Power**. Taking action on a defined stressor returns your power
where it belongs -- to you, not the stressor.

You can use a small notebook as
your Stress Log or create a folder in a digital application, such as Evernote
or Workflowy. _How _you create your
Stress Log is not the important part. Instead, it is actually taking the time
to define your stress, write it down and see it objectively so you can begin
solving it.

Stress busters are often as
simple as putting pen to paper (or stylist to touch screen). But _you _are the only one who can pick up the
pen and move forward toward a calmer day. Only then can you dedicate your
energy toward the things that matter.
