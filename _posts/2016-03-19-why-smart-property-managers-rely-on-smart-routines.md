# Why Smart Property
Managers Rely on Smart Routines

I started smoking
in high school. It was ironic because I was also on the track team shooting to
break the school record in the half-mile. The new record was not to be as my
lung power decreased every day.

Still, I was in
pretty good shape and vowed never to get out of it. It wasn't until my 40s that
I returned to running. Still a smoker, but a runner at heart. I thought
ultimately my running would overtake my desire to smoke.

And so it was.

It was not easy.
It could intentional planning and executing a strategy of change. But in the
end, I overcame one addiction and developed another.

That's how life can
be. We often get beaten up or beaten down by bad things only to find new good
things to replace them with.

****

**The Power of Routine**

The same goes for
our daily routines. We find ourselves
waking up blurry-eyed scanning our in-box to feed our addiction to be in the
know. 

We turn on the
news to catch up on the latest disaster so we're in the know about world
events.

We make mental
lists of everything that's got to get done that day so we have a sense of
direction and fill the need to have something to show for our efforts.

Is it any wonder
that we're finding ourselves further and further behind as the days go by?

****

**Why I Run**

So I decided to
change things...and for good reason. First, I was approaching my 50th birthday. That was as good a mile-marker as ever to become an ex-smoker.

Second was life
insurance. The premium rates for smokers was about 3X that of a non-smoker.

Third, was life _assurance._ I wanted desperately to see
my daughters graduate, get married and start families of their own.

With this intense
will to quit smoking, my running intensity also increased. The more conviction
I had to stop smoking became the fuel to increase my conviction to run.

So I continued to
run. But running in and of itself wasn't enough for me. I needed something to
boost my motivation. Out came the iPod. Perfect. Now I had company and the
surprise of not knowing which song would come up next in the shuffle.

Still, I needed
to know that I was improving. I needed a goal. Something in the future I could
strive for.

So I signed up
for a 5K race. That gave me the motivation to train, not just run. I envisioned
the finish line and the sense of pride for having prepared and done my best
that day.

****

**Sequential Routines**

My routine gradually
grew to include some speed work at the track and some cross-training at the
gym.

I found my
conviction grow into an addiction. I became addicted to the feeling I got from
training. I was addicted to the progress I was making by pushing myself just a
little bit more. 

My sleep was more
efficient, so I didn't need as much. My appetite grew, so I began making better
choices about what I ate. My mind was clearer, so I was able to make better
decisions.

But these all
came from a gradual build-up of routines. To incorporate all of these tactics
from day one would have been too much. Just one idea, one habit, one task day
by day until you can create something that works for you.

****

**Life Gets in the Way**

Of course,
routines get interrupted. Not every day goes according to plan. And that's OK.
As a runner, we're not supposed to run everyday. I still plan on it though.

I still pack my
bag every day with the intention of running. When the unexpected comes up
(which is becoming more "routine" these days---think about that for a second),
then I can respond knowing that I'll have gotten the training I intended when
the week began.

If you're
wondering how to break a habit, it might be worth seeing what good habit you
can form to replace it.

Be specific.

Be intentional.

Have an end game
before you start.

You might want to
post a picture of what life will be like when you engage in your new routine as
a reminder of why you're doing this in the first place.

For me, I want to
be around---and healthy---for all those mile-markers of life. So I have pictures of
my kids, pictures of distant lands and future destinations. And I even have a
few race medals scattered around to show me how I'll get there.

There are good
routines and not so good ones. Pick one to replace and understand why you want
the good one so much more than the "gratification" the bad one brings. You'll
delight in what's possible.
