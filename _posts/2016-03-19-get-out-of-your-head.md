Capturing epiphanies are tough. Many random thoughts arrive in the dead of night. Wishing I could simply replay the tapes at will never works. What was once a crystal clear image or message is gone the instant I try to recall it.

The other night I had three pressing thoughts I couldn't afford to forget. I hopped out of bed at 1:30am to write them down. I got two. The 3rd simply vanished.

I went back to bed and tried not to think about it. Within five minutes the 3rd thought came back. I told myself "That was easy. I'll remember that one now." Then a 4th and a 5th came right behind it. Up again to jot them down.

Since I'm up by 4:30am most mornings, the sleep I do get is a precious commodity. So back to the sack I go. I'm gonna get some sleep. This time I'm _serious_. 

Thought \#6, 7, 8 and 9 followed right afterward, of course.

2:30am.

3:00am.

3:15am.

I couldn't stop the flood of ideas. One led to another. Then another. And it all began with the initial three pressing thoughts. If they only knew what they started. 

Needless to say, I wouldn't be getting any more sleep that night. I couldn't have slept if you paid me. My mind was filled with non-stop, but welcome thoughts, solutions, and ideas.

So, like other days every blue moon, I was up by 3:30am actually writing and rewriting blog posts, course content and email copy.

I was on a roll. A wonderful, exciting and thought provoking roll.

I went on to crush it that day. I got to the office by 5:00am and put in four solid hours before my 9-to-5 kicked into gear.

I live for days like that.

And, it all began because I let my mind work during my slumber. As I allow sleep and thoughts to intermingle, often I get epiphanies. Finding ways to capture them is as important to me as the value of sleep and deep thought combined.

Thoughts come and go. When they come, capture them.
