As property managers, most of the time we know what we _should _do. You know, the actions we take to propel us forward, enable steady growth, and improve service quality---actions that work for us.

"Should dos" are the daily or weekly responsibilities we identify when we're able to focus, strategize, and solve problems creatively. They are the necessary, productive action steps we need to perform consistently to meet our short-term and long-term goals. 

Unfortunately, the "should dos" often get trumped by the "have tos."

Most of the time, the things we _should do _are put on hold or pushed off so that we can tackle more pressing, urgent needs. We shift our focus to putting out fires that, if left unattended, could wreak havoc on our properties.

But, when the _have to _is over, that is, when the fire is put out, we sometimes struggle to get back to the _should dos_.

It can be very difficult to switch from the high adrenaline rush from the fire you've just put out (_have to_) to a slower paced, yet vitally more important initiative (_should do_).

I remember a few years ago, I was starting a typical day working on an immense reforecast. It was our "6+6," which as most of you know, takes the first 6 months of actuals and reforecasts the next 6 months to predict how your year will be.

In the midst of this highly analytical, meticulous spreadsheet revision process, we received a "Code Gold" over the radio. At my property, this meant there was an elevator entrapment so we dropped everything and responded.

Even though my team and I had trained on the exact protocols to follow, everyone's adrenaline still spiked. This was a real emergency where people's lives were involved.

I instructed security to call the elevator company and get the ETA for a technician. While checking on the cab location, we made sure security was talking to the passengers and gathering information about their condition and safety.

As expected, our elevator technicians arrived shortly after the Code Gold was announced and got the passengers out safely. My team and I did our usual post-incident debrief and went back to work.

With adrenaline levels still high from the incident, I found it difficult to resume my focus on the reforecasting project. 

That is,until I changed my
mindset.

I used the energy buzz from the entrapment and channelled it toward this project in a way that made the shift easy and powerful.

Here's how I did it.

In our world, where _have dos _are normal and _should dos _are imperative to growth and
progress, we need to invest in learning how to make the transition smoother and
more effective.

The first and most transformative step is having an appreciative mindset. After executing their _have tos_, smart property managers make a mindful effort to embrace their _should dos _with gratitude.

Instead of seeing them as tasks they'll tackle when they have time, they recognize their _should dos _as a gateway to the ultimate success they seek. They work, and they work well.

By maintaining an appreciative mindset, smart property managers transform _should dos _into "get tos" -- pleasurable opportunities to contribute to something that will propel them forward and help them reach their goals.

When you _get to _do something, rather than feel burdened by it, it sheds a new light on your work. You begin to feel honored by the privilege to do - or strategically delegate - the very things that move your team forward, enable growth and heighten service levels.

Now, you actually _want _to do your _get tos_. You can't wait to do what you get to do! Remember, your _get tos _work, and they work well.

By creating a new mindset, you transform your _should dos_ to _get tos_. Before long, you start wanting your _get tos_. 

Quite simply, you _want what works_.

This concept became so profound for me that I decided to name my company Want What Works (d/b/a EverSmarts).

So, if you find yourself stuck fighting fires and dodging the all-important, game-changing projects on your goal list, challenge yourself to change the way you think about your _should dos_.

The next time you extinguish a fire or are "in between fires," shift your focus to your _should dos _and be thankful that they're yours.

When you start thinking of your _should dos _as _get tos_, you'll 'get to' feel the honor of doing worthy work and
you'll also 'get to' reap the rewards from your effort.
