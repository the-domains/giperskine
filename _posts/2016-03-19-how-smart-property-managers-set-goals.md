Are your
days goal-oriented? Or could you be called the "virtual fireman" because of all
the fires you douse during your workday?

No matter
how you answered either question, it always helps to step away from the
craziness of your day to assess your goals. Daily, weekly, monthly and yearly
goals are what drive us forward in our jobs and in life. 

Where are
you in terms of your goals? Is there a list of resolutions somewhere?

It goes
without saying that you must write down your goals. The act of forming words
and sentences clears any fuzziness about the outcome you want to achieve. 

Once you
have your goals clearly defined, take each one and break it down to action
steps. What are you going to have to accomplish to reach that goal? Who are you
going to have to contact or rely on? Writing the sequence down affirms your
goal and turns the action steps into a plan.

I keep a
daily action list I call "Gip's Big 3" each of which move me toward my most
important goals. I look at my Big 3 often throughout the day and check off my
progress. It reminds me of where I am going and keeps my efforts focused on
something bigger than trivia.

The next
step is to quantify your goals. "How much? By when?" is a great phrase to keep
in mind. Time can be used as your friend and motivator in moving forward on
your goals. 

Now that
you have your goals, actions steps and quantifications, review them to determine
which one is the most crucial to focus on first. Prioritizing your goals helps
you spend your time, energy and talent on the most important items on your
list. 

Setting goals is just one
of the essential pillars of EverSmarts(tm) and our **_Change Course _**program. "Goal
Getting" is where the real attainment comes in. That's next.
