# I'm just like you

Hi. I'm Gip and
I'm a property manager. 

I've been in the
commercial real estate industry since the mid '80s and have seen my share of
ups and downs in the market and the economy.

But through it
all, I've seen nothing but "ups" with my workload. It seems that we've all been
tasked with doing more with less.

If you're feeling
overwhelmed at the enormity of your workload and getting caught up never
happens, I'm here to tell you there's a way forward.

THE
SMART GET SMARTER

You probably
didn't land in this industry because of luck. You chose your career because you
had the smarts to recognize the wealth of opportunity in managing investment
real estate.

I seized the
"keys to the kingdom" shortly after college and learned lessons the hard way:
by falling flat on my face and then dusting myself off while I figured out what
happened. I became of student of trial and error and learned all I could to
grow in my career.

LEARN MORE TO EARN MORE

Even after I got
my real estate license, earned both the CPM(r) and CCIM(r) designations, I still
went back to school to learn more. I received my MBA in 2001 and kept going. I
loved learning so much because I had such great teachers.

On the job, I
learned from mentors and observed masters at their trade. I was mindful of what
they did differently that made them stand out.

PARALLEL
PATH

Early on in my
career, I was exposed to _Insight_, a
personal development audio newsletter distributed by Nightingale-Conant. On
each cassette tape (I know, we've come a long way since that technology), Earl
Nightingale offered some of the most profound and straightforward life lessons
I had ever heard.

They hit home and
I was hooked! Who knew such a wealth of wisdom was pre-assembled and available
through a catalog? So I began my "wisdom quest."

INSATIABLE
HUNGER

I devoured
everything I could from Zig Ziglar, Tony Robbins, Tom Peters, Brian Tracy, Jack
Canfield, Deepak Chopra, Bob Proctor, Denis Waitley, Napoleon Hill and many
more.

My personal
library is filled wall-to-wall with non-fiction books and programs all created
for self-improvement, character development, leadership, time management **_and
success._**

I've spent six
years studying and being trained by one of the premier masters of personal
development and America's Success Coach, Jack Canfield.

YOUR
INVITATION

As your mentor
and guide, I offer you what I've gleaned over the decades from life experiences
(both on and off the job) and my immersion in personal development training.

If you're looking
for an all-in-one cure-all for what prevents you from attaining success, then
keep looking. But if you're intent on reclaiming your passion and fully
committed to finding a way through, I invite you to STEP UP and STEP OUT with
me on a journey of a lifetime.

Don't kid
yourself. There will be some heavy lifting involved. But it will be meaningful
work---work you've always intended on doing that brings joy and fulfillment to
your life.

But you're not
alone and you'll have help along the way. We're all in this together! Come join
in!

Now. Go. Do.

To Your Perpetual
Success,

Gip
