# What Smart
Property Managers Want

It's funny how we know what works
and what doesn't; usually after trial and error. We often know what we ought to
do, but somehow resist always doing it, as though another way might be better.

\* Skipping a workout

\* Having another drink

\* Watching the next episode

\* Eating a second scoop

They all get rationalized as though
our gratification is increased by choosing this path. "Skipping a workout is SO
much easier than working out. I'm better off staying put."

We learn how untrue that reality
was after the fact; sometimes immediately after the fact; sometimes while actually doing what
we've allowed ourselves to do (or not do). "I can't believe I'm eating this,
but it's SO good!"

Delay. Indulge. Ignore. Succumb.

Once we realize how damaging these
rationalizations are, our awareness increases. Increased awareness is helpful,
but isn't enough to change a behavior.

Knowing what works and doing what works casual acquaintances. Until we actually want what works do we begin to
bridge the gap between "have to" and "get to" and enjoying
both the process of doing and its fruits.

When you want things that work badly enough, the doing
becomes easier. Success must follow. Period.

Describe things that work for you in your life. Financial. Physical.
Relationships. Things at work. Things at home. Think of why you want them; why
you need them to continue to work and serve you in your life. You'll be on the
right track.
