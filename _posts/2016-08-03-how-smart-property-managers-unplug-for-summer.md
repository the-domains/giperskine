The thought of summer vacation can elicit many images---from rest and relaxation on a white sandy beach or a "staycation" with coffee on the patio, lounging by the pool. 

Some of us like to head out to the great outdoors for lots of physical activity like scaling a mountain or two. Then there are the urban adventurers among us who yearn to buzz through a distant city to check out all the tourist attractions cited trusty travel guide.

I just returned from a blissful week in New Hampshire with my father and my daughters. Three generations of Erskines stayed on the same lake where they filmed "On Golden Pond" and soaked up the serenity that place is known for. It was pure bliss for all of us.

It matters not what we choose to do with our well-deserved vacations----what matters is that we take them.

**Vacations: Good**

Vacations are necessary for our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. They recharge our batteries and help us push the reset button. 

According to researchers at the Boston College Center for Work and Family Life, there are a number of physical, mental, and career benefits derived from taking a vacation. These include: less stress and better heart health, increased performance and focus, and fresh perspectives which can lead to innovative ideas----benefiting both you and your company.

**Stress: Bad**

Yet, many of us have difficulty with leaving work behind. We've become addicted to the busyness of our routine and feel uncomfortable when we are unplugged from our emails, voice mails, and text messages for any duration. And if we've left some lingering "undones" back at the office, vacations can be a serious source of stress. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/29d7d8bc-e6fd-46b6-b9a7-67e070fb2678.jpg)

Tending to the needs and desires of all vacationers, especially if we have children, can be quite a juggle----and exhausting----as well. We may avoid taking vacations just to alleviate any anxiety we have about keeping our loved ones happy.

Making a plan with some level of compromise is in order so that the interests of your travel companions have been satisfied as well. 

To ensure we get the most from our vacation time, there are a few things to do before we close our office door behind us. 

1\. Decide to Go Dark -- The first step is to make a commitment to yourself and your loved ones to unplug. Many of us have that strange sense of pride by multitasking while away.

We wake up before the family to check emails. Sneak away to make an important client call. Or worse, blatantly work in the hotel room while the family waits to leave for Disney World!

2\. Make your "Must Do" List -- You've got both personal and professional tasks that are "musts" before you go. Keep it short and keep it simple. Don't let your "shoulds" creep in. If they do, delegate them. 

3\. Project Forward -- Look at what's coming due not only while you're away, but the week you come back. Create a plan and delegate action items to your team in advance.

4\. Set Expectations -- Tell your boss and team you are not available unless it's an emergency that _only _you can solve. Don't let them in unless they are absolutely invited by you.

Vacation time is part of your compensation package----and we get only so many days of it----and days on this earth! Enjoy each one of them. 

Turn off your cell phone and leave your computer at home. Don't blur the lines of work and personal life in the name of being a "team player." You deserve the time off and your family deserves to have you present.

When you return from vacation, you may notice that your relationships with your family and coworkers have actually improved----and your performance will be enhanced----far more than if you had stayed behind, literally or figuratively, with your nose to the grindstone. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c2c9c6d0-3dac-4c0c-b88d-476d249e73c1.jpg)

Stop telling yourself, "Next time, it'll be different." Dare to be different _now _and set the boundaries and rules you agree to play by and don't cheat. You'll only be short-changing yourself and the time away with the people you love.
