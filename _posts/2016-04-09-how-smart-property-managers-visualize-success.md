The
best athletes don't just train their way to victory. They visualize themselves
performing, executing and - of course -
winning. 

Take Olympic sprinters. Long before they arrive to the track, they visualize readying
themselves at their mark and the blast of the starting pistol as they burst
forth toward the finish line. They imagine racing past competitors, crossing
the tape first and the immense joy of taking a victory lap draped in their
country's flag.

Don't
get me wrong - it takes a lot of sweat, dedication and natural aptitude to
succeed in any sport. Visualization alone isn't the only ingredient to achieve
greatness. Still, it has become a treasured tool used by scores of top
athletes.

Visualization
is an equally powerful tool in the professional world. It's much harder, if not
impossible, to create a reality if you've never imagined it coming to fruition.

That's
why smart property managers visualize success as an integral part of their daily
routine.

Take
a moment to picture what it would be like to manage your time, your team
and your actions like a fine Swiss watch. You rise early, create efficient
routines, and command the respect of your team. Everyone is crystal clear on
what is expected from them and understands the actions they need to take to
fulfill their responsibilities. Their coordinated efforts come together to
produce the desired outcomes for your clients, and the smiles on their faces
are priceless. 

Sounds good, doesn't it?

Well, the first concrete step
you can take toward achieving success in your life is to make time to define
and visualize what success looks like for **you**.

Here's how you can do it:

****

**Step
1\. Put It in Writing.**

Every morning, I take a moment to consider the top
three priorities that I want to tackle that day and record them in my Day Timer
(yes, good old fashioned pen and paper). I call these priorities "Gip's
Big 3" and do my utmost to accomplish them before dealing with any other
tasks or responsibilities. When you put _your _big three in writing, you clarify exactly what you need to accomplish, make
them tangible, and enable yourself to clearly evaluate your progress.

**Step
2\. Make Picture Perfect.**

Next, I sit back, close my eyes and actually
envision myself accomplishing the things I set out to achieve that day. This
visualization process gives me a motivational push. I imagine myself actually
overcoming hurdles and undertaking tasks that may be difficult or even uncomfortable.
Doing so shows me that taking action is not only within my power, but actually
very possible. 

Visualizing things all come
together also gives me an opportunity to consider what it will take to achieve my
goals. Sometimes, I'll realize I need to start my day tackling a priority
before responding to a sprawling list of emails. Or I'll have an insight that I
can delegate to a member of my team, effectively freeing up time to address the
other priorities on my list. 

****

**Step
3\. Hold Yourself Accountable.**

This third step is key. Find
an accountability partner you can share your daily goals with. An
accountability partner can be a mentor, respected friend or coach who will hold
your feet to the fire when you say you're going to do something. They keep you
honest and help you evaluate your progress. 

Every morning, I share my
priorities with my accountability partner. The next morning, before sharing my
new goals for the day, I have to report how I did the day before. This pushes
me to make the progress I might not otherwise make if I had no one to own up
to.

****

**Making
Visualization A Daily Habit**

I carry my priorities with me -
literally - throughout the day. Keep your Day Timer - or whatever daily journal
works for you - close at hand. It'll serve as a reminder of your priorities,
and you'll feel accomplished when you're able to cross them off your list. 

When you take a badly needed
coffee break, review your progress and make sure your actions are aligned with
what matters most.

By being more conscious of
your daily priorities, you're able to better identify what _isn't _part of the vision, eliminate the noise and stay focused on
the end-game.

And remember, the smartest
property managers are still human. Sometimes even the clearest visual image of
an ideal future gets clouded by the myriad of distractions and changing
priorities that come their way.

But, they can still summon the
powerful forces of visualization for their benefit. They realize that better resources, ideas and outcomes come
from seeing things through an ideal lens.
