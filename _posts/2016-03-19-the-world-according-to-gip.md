# The World According To Gip

DALLAS - March 19, 2016 - When considering the things I remain grateful for, I've created a list of categories all starting with "F" that are top of mind:

**1\. ****Faith** - At the center of it all and surrounding it all, there is God. From the very depths of my soul to the heights of the heavens, He remains the constant.

**2\. Family** - Why else are we here but to love, share, engage, guide, tease, nurture, play with family? All family members are my reminders to be a person of character.

**3\. Friends** - The extension of family are those sometimes closest, sometimes furthest, but always a cheerful presence that helps remind me of the best of times.

**4\. Fitness** - If you've got your health, you've got the ability to impact the world. I remain committed to maintaining excellent health so I can be there when it matters.

**5\. Finances** - Life in America is a constant reminder of necessity of positive cash flow and a growing net worth. The temporary dips into debt should be used wisely if at all.

**6\. Fun** - I remember the times when I laughed so hard my cheeks hurt and my abs cramped. For me, life of strict duty must be tempered with a continual downplay of seriousness and an emphasis on laughter.

**7\. Freedom** - I used to work weekends so I wouldn't have to in the future. For me, that was freedom. Now I build revenue-generating info products to benefit mankind and perpetuate a new level of freedom.

There could be others for sure. But for me, 7 is always a lucky number as well as being short enough to remember. It's important to recall what's important, what matters and why I'm here. The list is my mantra. It represents what's truly vital...according to me.
