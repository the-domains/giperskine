# How Smart
Property Managers Find Sanity

The term "insane" has
turned the corner. What was once stereotyped as a misunderstood abnormal mental
condition is now in vogue.

* We have the insanity
workout
* We boast about our insane
workload
* We went to an insane concert
last night. "It was crazy. Sick. Insane."

Did you catch the one about the
workload? Or did you blow right by it?

Awareness of an insane workload is a quantum leap forward. But awareness
is only half the battle. Allowing insanity to be your 'new normal' is truly insane. Or is it?

When we continuously endure high
levels of work overload, we experience "overwhelm." That's bad. But,
as you read this, at least you are consciously aware of it. That's good.

Without awareness, we plod through our
days numb to the idea of a better alternative.

Maybe any alternative is better than your current reality. 

And that's where we sometimes allow ourselves to get lost
seeking any distraction that looks like a break from the norm.

Rest
assured. Sanity is possible. It's been there
all the time. It's there for the asking. But you must seek it. Thirst for it.
Make time to embrace it. Here are three steps you can do right now:

1\. Your first step is to simply
pause for a moment and dwell in the blissful knowledge that a better
alternative exists. 

Do it right now. Just for a moment. Close your eyes and smile.

2\. Assuming a glimmer of hope
was revealed, your next step is to ask for help. Ask yourself "What is your single largest problem that,
once solved, could pave the way to sanity in your work day?" Think. 

Do this right now. Then
post your problem in the comment box below. Be ready to receive wisdom.

3\. The third step: relax right now. Don't
worry. You won't look foolish. You recognize that enduring overwhelm is not
sustainable. You are ready to do something about it. It's time to get off the
insanity treadmill.

Await the
wisdom that will come. Check back for feedback and ideas worth testing. Your
road will get smoother...and saner.
