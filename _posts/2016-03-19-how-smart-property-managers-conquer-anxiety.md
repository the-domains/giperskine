Have you ever had a project or
situation that you dread, because you know the outcome could reflect poorly on
you or your team? Do you avoid the email or phone call because you imagine that
it's more bad news? Sometimes we delay the pain through avoidance.

But, avoidance of perceived
negative information only does one thing: increases anxiety. To feel better, we
avoid near-term pain, providing momentary relief, but multiplying the long-term
anxiety by 100X.

How do you get off the avoidance
train heading for a bridge that only partly spans the chasm of failure?

Here's an idea: breathe.

In Eastern traditions, the
breath is seen as a way to return to yourself.

Zen Masters have been using and teaching simple breathing techniques to clear
the mind and restore our sense of calm.

Whenever you feel that knot in your
stomach because of a negative situation, follow these simple steps:

1\. Take a deep breath
through your nose and count to seven during your inhale.

2\. At number seven, hold
your breath for five counts.

3\. Then exhale slowly and
fully for seven counts.

4\. Repeat three times.

This 7-5-7 cycle should take
about a minute. If you still feel anxious, do another round of deep breathing.

Now, return to your "problem" and
see if you don't feel calmer and more in control. Your mind should be quieter
and the negative thoughts are more distant or non-existent. With your mind
calm, ask yourself how you can solve the problem in the most effective manner
possible. 

Write down all answers that come
to you. Do not censor or judge them. Simply act as the scribe and write the
ideas down.

You might try another round of
deep breathing and then review the answers or ideas with your team. Are any of
them feasible? Reasonable? What action could you take right now to move
forward? Take it.

Anxiety should be a forgotten
shadow and now you can see a realistic way forward. There is no need to avoid
anything, because there is nothing to fear.

And all because you remembered
how to breathe.
