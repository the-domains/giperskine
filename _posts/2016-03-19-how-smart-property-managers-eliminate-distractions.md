If you're anything
like me, you are bombarded with problems all day long. As property managers,
that's just what we do.

You give your
attention and your time to whatever comes your way. After all, if not
you, then who?

The problem is
some us actually _feed _on this frenzy of activity. We identify with it.
If we're not busy all the time, we just feel a little off. It's like we're not
doing enough and that feeling gnaws at us.

I'm going to
suggest how you _respond _to the many "shiny objects" will make the
difference between being busy and being productive.

Here's a strategy
that might help you survive the maladies of this intoxicating temptation I call
"shiny object syndrome" (hint: SOS).

****

**Problem****:** You
can't see the forest through the trees. You identify with being busy and react
to every issue that comes your way.

****

**Solution****:** Focus on fewer,
vitally important things, one at a time.

****

**Benefit****:** Your efforts
will result in your highest return on your time. You win. How do you do
this?

**1\. Block your calendar.** Even if it's only for an hour.

**2\. Close your door.** Your open-door policy is great, but not
expected 100% of the time. If you have a door, close it. If not, find a quiet
place to concentrate.

**3\. Mute your phone.** Like texting and driving, it can wait.

**4\. Disable your alerts.** These incessant reminders only take your
focus away from your priorities and tempt you to respond to someone else's
agenda. Don't. At the very least, mute your computer. One step further:
unsubscribe to everything you don't read.

**5\. List your Big 3\.** Of everything you've got on your plate,
list the top three items that, when accomplished, create the greatest
advantage for you. Call them your Big 3\.

**6\. Tackle your Big \#1\.** Envision your end game on your Big \#1\. Organize
your message. Recruit your team. Delegate, divide and conquer. Keep at it until
you're done. Then go to your Big \#2\.

****

**Question: **How can you
reduce YOUR temptation to chase the shiny objects so you focus on the one thing
that truly matters? What do your choices say about you?

Please reply to me with your feedback and suggestions on how you combat
SOS. I read every message so please share your thoughts.
